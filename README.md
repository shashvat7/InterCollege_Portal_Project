# InterCollege_Portal_Project
This is a web application designed using Django, ReactJs and Bootstrap.
This is aimed at increasing communication among the students, faculties and authorities of the college.
This is equipped with standard features like post, comment, answer etc, and also with a secure login verification that only allows people from the college to access this portal.
This was submitted as my minor project with 2 other team members.
